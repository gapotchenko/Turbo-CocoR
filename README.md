# Turbo Coco/R for .NET
Turbo Coco/R is a compile-time compiler generator for .NET which takes an attributed grammar of a source language and generates a scanner and a parser for this language. It is based on the de-facto [Coco/R standard](https://ssw.jku.at/Research/Projects/Coco/) and extends it to be more useful in commercial settings.

The produced scanners and parsers do not have external dependendencies and thus can be embedded into any project at the source level.
